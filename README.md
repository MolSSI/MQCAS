# MQCAS
History information for the data in the MolSSI QCArchive Server (MQCAS)

This repository servers several goals:
 - Discuss the MQCAS data and future computational campaigns
 - Report issues with the data
 - Request additional collections or computations on those collections
 - Volunteer compute time for the MQCAS server
 - Upload new collections to the MQCAS server

This repository is quite new and needs a substantial infrastructure build out before it can meet these goals.
Please check back periodically or open an issue or pull request to help out!
